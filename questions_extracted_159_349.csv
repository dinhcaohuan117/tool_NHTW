essay,2,"+ 0.5 (1) , where the expected inflation is . Thus, if = 7% , then the fed funds rate should be set to 7 + 2 + 0.5(5) + 0.5 = 12% . b. Suppose half of the Fed economists forecast inflati on to be 6%, and half of Fed economists forecast inflation to be 8%. If the Fed uses the average of these two forecasts as its measure of expected inflation, the n at what target should the fed funds rate be set according to the Taylor rule? If the measure of expected inflation is the average of the two forecasts, then = 0.5 (6% + 8%) = 7% . In this case, the Taylor rule would again imply a setting of the fed funds rate of 12%. c. Now suppose half of the Fed economists forecast inf lation to be 0%, and half forecast inflation to be 14%. If the Fed uses the a verage of these two forecasts as its measure of expected inflation, then at what tar get should the fed funds rate be set according to the Taylor rule? If the measure of expected inflation is the average of the two forecasts, then = 0.5 (0% + 14%) = 7%. In this case, = the Taylor rule would again imply a setting of the fed funds rate of 12%. d. Given your",,,,,,"s to parts (a)–(c) above, do you t hink it is a good idea for monetary policymakers to use a strict interpretatio n of the Taylor rule as a basis for setting policy? Why or why not? Probably not. The Taylor rule doesn't take into acc ount the possibility of a wide variation in forecasts. ANSWERS TO DATA ANALYSIS PROBLEMS 1. Go to the Bank of Albania’s exchange rate database (https://www.bankofalbania.org/Markets/Official_exc hange_rate/), and find data on the exchange rate of Albanian Lek (ALL) per Euros ( EUR). A Volkswagen Golf can be purchased in Frankfurt, Germany, for €18,000 or in Tirana, Albania, for ALL 2,268,000. a. Use the most recent exchange rate available to calc ulate the real exchange rate of the Frankfurt VW Golf per Tirana VW Golf. b. Based on your answer to part (a), are Volkswagen Go lfs relatively more expensive in Frankfurt or in Tirana. c. What price in Albanian Lek would make the Volkswage n Golf equally expensive in both locations, all else being equal? 2. Go to the St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database a nd find data on the personal consumption expenditure price index (PCECTPI), real GDP (GDPC1), an estimate of potential GDP (GDPPOT), and the federal funds rate (FEDFUNDS). For the price index, adjust the units setting to “Percent Change From Year Ago” to convert the data to the inflation rate; for the federal funds r ate, change the frequency setting to “Quarterly.” Download the data into a spreadsheet. Assuming the inflation target is 2% and the equilibrium real fed funds rate is 2%, c alculate the inflation gap and the output gap for each quarter, from 2000 until the mo st recent quarter of data available. Calculate the output gap as the percenta ge deviation of output from the potential level of output. a. Use the output and inflation gaps to calculate, for each quarter, the fed funds rate predicted by the Taylor rule. Assume that the weigh ts on inflation stabilization and output stabilization are both ½ (see the formul a in the chapter). Compare the current (quarterly average) federal funds rate to t he federal funds rate prescribed by the Taylor rule. Does the Taylor rule accurately predict the current rate? Briefly comment. For the most recent period in 2020:Q2, the federal funds rate is 0.06%, while the Taylor rule predicts –3.34%, underrepresenting actu al policy by a gap of 3.4 percentage points. Compared to other significant de viations, this is a fairly large departure from the baseline Taylor rule. b. Create a graph that compares the predicted Taylor r ule values with the actual quarterly federal funds rate averages. How well, in general, does the Taylor rule prediction fit the average federal funds rate? Brie fly explain. See the graph below. The Taylor rule since 2000 has periods in which they are fairly closely correlated, particularly from 2000 t o 2002. However, there are significant gaps in other times, or periods in whic h they do not seem to move together, such as the period from 2002 to 2006. Fro m 2008 onward, there are significant differences between the two, particular ly the period late in 2008 through 2010, in which the Taylor rule predicts the federal funds rate should be negative by as much as almost –4%, which is not pos sible. It also predicted a significant rise in the federal funds rate in 2011, which did not materialize, and generally speaking, the post-crisi s Taylor rule has significantly overprescribed the actual fed funds rate. The coron avirus pandemic period beginning in 2020 created sharp declines in the act ual fed funds rate and Taylor rule implied rate. c. Based on the results from the 2008–2009 period, exp lain the limitations of the Taylor rule as a formal policy tool. How do these l imitations help explain the use of nonconventional monetary policy during this peri od? Since the Federal funds rate was at the effective l ower bound during that time, conventional monetary policy through adjustments in the federal funds rate was not possible, and highlights a limitation of the Ta ylor rule: under ‟normal” conditions the Taylor rule provides a good approxim ation to appropriate federal funds rate policy. However in extreme situations su ch as the financial crisis period and the coronavirus pandemic period, the Tay lor rule is less useful, since other (nonconventional) monetary policy tools are n eeded to achieve stimulus. d. Suppose Congress changes the Fed’s mandate to a hie rarchical one in which inflation stabilization takes priority over output stabilization. In this context, recalculate the predicted Taylor rule value for eac h quarter since 2000, assuming that the weight on inflation stabilization is ¾ and the weight on output stabilization is ¼. Create a graph showing the Tayl or rule prediction calculated in part (a), the prediction using new “hierarchical” Taylor rule, and the fed funds rate. How, if at all, does changing the mandate cha nge the predicted policy paths? How would the fed funds rate be affected by a hierarchical mandate? Briefly explain. See the graph below. For the most part, the baselin e Taylor rule and the hierarchical Taylor rule predict nearly the same fe deral funds paths. The only significant deviations are from 2008 to 2014, where the hierarchical version predicts a significantly higher federal funds rate due to the inflation spike during that time. And from about 2010 to 2014, it implied a federal funds rate around 2%, which is much higher than during that time and what the baseline rule predicts, and the actual fed funds rate was. For th e most recent period of 2020:Q2, under such a hierarchical Taylor rule, the federal funds rate would be predicted to be about –1.1%, much lower than the current 0.06%. e. Assume again equal weights of ½ on inflation and ou tput stabilization, and suppose instead that beginning after the end of 200 8, the equilibrium real fed funds rate declines by 0.05 each quarter (i.e., 200 9:Q1 is 1.95, then 1.90, etc.), and once it reaches zero, it remains at zero therea fter. How does it affect the prescribed fed funds rate? Why might this be import ant for policymakers to take into consideration? A decline in the equilibrium real fed funds rate ha s the effect of reducing the implied Taylor rule fed funds rate lower. In fact, under this policy rule, it would have implied the fed funds rate to be negative duri ng 2015, which also coincided with a period of low inflation. Of all three of the variations, the declining equilibrium real rate rule is the closest to the ac tual path of the fed funds rate since the financial crisis period. This may help ex plain why the actual path of the fed funds rate was lower than standard Taylor rules would imply. Moreover, if the real equilibrium fed funds rate did decline, but wa s not taken into account (for instance, by using the baseline rule in part (a)), this would imply that monetary policy would be overly contractionary. The graph be low shows the distinction between the baseline Taylor rule and the declining natural rate Taylor rule. -4 -2 02468 2000-01-01 2001-02-01 2002-03-01 2003-04-01 2004-05-01 2005-06-01 2006-07-01 2007-08-01 2008-09-01 2009-10-01 2010-11-01 2011-12-01 2013-01-01 2014-02-01 2015-03-01 2016-04-01 2017-05-01 2018-06-01 2019-07-01 Implied and Actual Fed Funds Rate Taylor Rules - Baseline vs. Hierarchical Baseline Taylor Rule Hierarchical Taylor Rule Federal Funds Rate -6 -4 -2 02468 2000-01-01 2001-03-01 2002-05-01 2003-07-01 2004-09-01 2005-11-01 2007-01-01 2008-03-01 2009-05-01 2010-07-01 2011-09-01 2012-11-01 2014-01-01 2015-03-01 2016-05-01 2017-07-01 2018-09-01 2019-11-01 Implied and Actual Fed Funds Rate Taylor Rules - Baseline vs. Declining Natural Rate Baseline Taylor Rule Declining Natural Rate Taylor Rule Federal Funds Rate 1 Copyright©2022PearsonEducation,Ltd.The Economics ofMoney,BankingandFinancial Markets,13e (Mishkin),Global Edition Chapter 20 QuantityTheory,Inflation and the Demand for Money 20.1 QuantityTheoryofMoney"

essay,2007,Linear (2008 to,,,,,,
essay,2019,Chapter 21,,,,,,"S TO QUESTIONS 1. “Planned investment spending is equal to the total spending by businesses on new physical capital” Is this statement true, false, or uncertain? Explai n your answer. The statement is false. New homes should also be in cluded in planned investment spending. 2. Why is inventory investment counted as part of aggr egate spending if it isn’t actually sold to the final end user? Since inventories of unsold goods are goods that ha ve been produced, then in an accounting sense, they add to output and hence aggr egate demand. However, since the final end user hasn’t purchased them yet, they are counted as inventory until they are sold. 3. “Since inventories can be costly to hold, firms’ pl anned inventory investment should be zero, and firms should acquire inventory only th rough unplanned inventory accumulation.” Is this statement true, false, or uncertain? Expla in your answer. False. Although inventories are costly to hold, man y firms prefer to have extra inventories of unsold goods on hand in the event th at there is an unpredictable increase in demand for their goods, because this al lows firms to satisfy customers’ demands. As a result, planned inventory investment may very well be positive. 4. During and in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007–2009, planned investment fell substantially despite significant decreases in the real interest rate. What factors related to the planned investment function could ex plain this? During the height of the crisis, financial friction s f increased dramatically, which effectively raised the real cost of investment. In addition, firms’ planned autonomous investment I decreased dramatically as the prospects for econom ic growth and profits in the future weakened sharply. Both of the se factors reduced planned investment, even though real interest rates may hav e decreased. 5. If households and firms believe the economy will be in a recession in the future, will this necessarily cause a recession, or have any imp act on output at all? These shifts in “animal spirits,” according to Keyn es, could very well create a recession. If the beliefs are strong enough, this c ould significantly reduce autonomous consumption and autonomous planned investment to th e point where equilibrium output decreases substantially, leading to a recess ion. 6. Why do increases in the real interest rate lead to decreases in net exports, and vice versa? When the real interest rate increases, this increas es the demand for domestic assets, resulting in an appreciation of the domestic curren cy. As a result, imported goods become cheaper domestically, and exported goods bec ome more expensive to foreigners. This reduces net exports, implying an i nverse relationship between the real interest rate and net exports. 7. Why does equilibrium output increase as the margina l propensity to consume increases? When the marginal propensity to consume ( mpc ) increases, this leads to a larger multiplier effect for any given change in spending, resulting in higher output. Put another way, when the mpc increases, this leads to a higher amount of consum ption spending out of disposable income. This leads to mo re production, which leads to higher income, leading to further increases in spen ding. 8. If firms suddenly become more optimistic about the profitability of investment and planned investment spending rises by €150 billion, while consumers become more pessimistic and autonomous consumer spending falls by €150 billion, what happens to aggregate output? Nothing. The €150 billion increase in planned inves tment spending is offset in full by the €150 billion decline in autonomous consumer exp enditure, so autonomous spending and aggregate output remain unchanged. 9. If an increase in autonomous consumer expenditure i s matched by an equal increase in taxes, will aggregate output rise or fall? Rise. The fall in spending from an increase in taxe s is always less than the change in taxes because the marginal propensity to consume is less than 1. By contrast, autonomous spending rises one-for-one with a change in autonomous consumer expenditure. If taxes and autonomous consumer expen diture rise by the same amount, autonomous spending must rise, and aggregate output also rises. 10. If a change in the interest rate has no effect on p lanned investment spending or net exports, what does this imply about the slope of th e IS curve? In this case, as interest rates fall, planned inves tment spending and net exports do not change, so equilibrium output remains unchanged. Th is means that the IS curve is vertical. 11. Inventories typically increase starting at the begi nning of recessions, and begin to decline near the end of recessions. What does this say about the relationship between planned spending and aggregate output over the busi ness cycle? At the beginning of recessions, planned spending fa lls as consumers reduce spending and firms reduce investment, while production gener ally stays constant. As a result, an excess supply of goods is produced, leading to r ising inventories. In the middle stages of recessions, firms may reduce production, but this may also be met with further decreases in planned spending leading to fu rther buildup of inventories. However, near the end of a recession, firms are slo w to increase production, while planned spending typically increases; this leads to reductions in inventories due to the excess demand for goods. 12. Why do companies cut production when they find that their unplanned inventory investment is greater than zero? If they didn’t cut production, what effect would this have on their profits? Why? Companies cut production when their unplanned inven tory investment is greater than zero, because they are then producing more than the y can sell. If they continue at current production, profits will suffer because the y are building up unwanted inventory, which is costly to store and finance. 13. You read in a blog, that companies in India are bec oming less confident about investment profitability, so they will decrease pla nned investment spending in the near future. What do you think will happen to aggregate demand? Since this is an autonomous decrease in planned inv estment spending, it will decreases aggregate demand . 14. In each of the cases below, determine whether the I S curve shifts to the right or left, does not shift, or is indeterminate in the directio n of shift. a. The real interest rate decreases in China. This is a movement along the IS curve, so it does n ot shift the IS curve. b. The marginal propensity to consume by the populatio n declines. This results in a decrease in equilibrium output at any given interest rate, which shifts the IS curve to the left. c. Financial frictions increase in India. Equilibrium output decreases at any given interest rate, which shifts the IS curve to the left. d. Autonomous consumption decreases. Equilibrium output decreases at any given interest rate, which shifts the IS curve to the left. e. The new Italian government decreases both taxes and government spending by the same amount. Equilibrium output decreases at any given interest rate, which shifts the IS curve to the left. f. The sensitivity of net exports to changes in the re al interest rate decreases. Equilibrium output increases at any given interest rate, which shifts the IS curve to the right. g. The new Spanish government provides tax incentives for research and development programs for firms. Equilibrium output increases at any given interest rate, which shifts the IS curve to the right. 15. “The fiscal stimulus package of 2009 caused the IS curve to shift to the left, since output decreased and unemployment increased after t he policies were implemented.” Is this statement true, false, or uncertain? Explai n your answer. False. Although the IS curved shifted to the left during the period of th e financial crisis, this is because of external factors which c aused a sharp decline in consumption and investment, such as financial frictions and sha rp decreases in autonomous consumption and investment. If the stimulus package had not been in place, the IS curve would have shifted much farther to the left. 16. When the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its poli cy interest rate in 2020, how, if at all, should the IS curve have been affected? Briefl y explain . The IS curve is not affected at all in theory, so it does not shift. Changes in the real interest rate represent movements along a given IS curve, but they do not shift the curve. 17. Suppose you read that prospects for stronger future economic growth have led the dollar to strengthen and stock prices to increase. a. What effect does the strengthened dollar have on th e IS curve? A more expensive dollar will result in fewer U.S. e xports and more U.S. imports (everything else the same), therefore decreasing ne t exports. Graphically, this shifts the IS curve to the left, decreasing aggregate output at every interest rate. b. What effect does the increase in stock prices have on the IS curve? Usually the increase in stock prices is interpreted as having a positive effect on autonomous planned investment, as investors become more confident about the future prospects of the economy. Therefore, we shou ld expect autonomous planned investment to increase and the IS curve to shift to the right. c. What is the combined effect of these two events on the IS curve? This is an example in which it is quite difficult t o measure the net effect of these events. Depending on the relative magnitude of the shifts, the IS curve might end up shifting to the left, to the right, or not shift ing at all. This problem arises because these events have opposite effects on the IS curve. ANSWERS TO APPLIED PROBLEMS 18. Your sister Yennefer asks you to help her to calcul ate the value of the consumption function at each level of income in the table below if autonomous consumption = 200, taxes = 100, and mpc = 0.5. Income Y Disposable Income YD Consumption C 0 100 200 300 400 Income Y Disposable Income YD Consumption C 0 –100 150 100 0 200 200 100 250 300 200 300 400 300 350 19. Assume that autonomous consumption is £1,625 billio n and disposable income is £11,500 billion. Calculate consumption expenditure if an increase of £1,000 in disposable income leads to an increase of £750 in c onsumption expenditure. If an increase of £1,000 in disposable income leads to an increase of £750 in consumption expenditure, then mpc = 0.75. Using thi s implies that C = 1,625 + 0.75 x 11,500 = 10,250. Consumption expenditure is therefo re £10,250 billion. 20. Suppose that Dell Corporation has 20,000 computers in its warehouses on December 31, 2022, ready to be shipped to merchants (each co mputer is valued at $500). By December 31, 2023, Dell Corporation has 25,000 comp uters ready to be shipped, each valued at $450. a. Calculate Dell’s inventory on December 31, 2022. Dell’s inventory on December 31, 2022, is the marke t value of the 20,000 computers at its warehouses. Therefore, Dell’s inve ntory equals 20,000 × $500 = $10,000,000 on December 31, 2022. b. Calculate Dell’s inventory investment in 2023. Dell’s inventory spending is the change in the leve l of its inventory during the course of 2023. On December 31, 2023, Dell’s invent ory equals 25,000 × $450 = $11,250,000. Therefore, Dell’s inventory spending i n 2023 is $1,250,000 = $11,250,000 − $10,000,000. c. What happens to inventory spending during the early stages of an economic recession? During the early stages of an economic recession, a s soon as households’ income starts to fall, firms realize that their sales drop . This results in fewer orders by their dealers and therefore an increase in the numb er of goods they stock at their warehouses (since they probably have already decide d about production levels for that period). The consequence is that inventory spe nding will be positive for some time, but firms will quickly cut production and wil l try to sell their already manufactured goods before increasing production aga in. 21. Suppose that the consumption function in Argentina is C = 100 + 0.75YD, I = 200, government spending is 200, and net exports are zer o, what will be the equilibrium level of output? What will happen to aggregate outp ut if government spending rises by 200? An equilibrium output of 2,000 occurs when Y = Yad and the aggregate demand function Yad = C + I + G + NX = 500 + 0.75Y. Solvin g for Y implies 0.25Y = 500, or Y = 2000. If government spending rises by 200, e quilibrium output will rise by 800 to 2,800. 22. If the marginal propensity to in Italy consume is 0 .75, by how much would government spending have to rise to increase output by €1,000 billion? By how much would taxes need to decrease to increase output by €1,000 billion? The change in Output Y is given as the change in sp ending G, multiplied by 1/(1 − mpc). Thus €1000 = 4 × G, implying government spend ing would have to increase by €250 billion to increase equilibrium output by €100 0 billion. Alternatively, the change in output is given as the change in taxes T, multiplied by [mpc]/(1 − mpc). Thus €1000 =3xT, implying that taxes would have to decrease by €333.3 billion to increase equilibrium output by €1000 billion. 23. Assuming both taxes and government spending increas e by the same amount, derive an expression for the effect on equilibrium output. Formally, the effects on output from a change in go vernment spending and a change in taxes are given, respectively, as YG = G/(1 – mpc ) and YT = –T  mpc /(1 – mpc ). If both taxes and spending increase by the same amo unt, then G = T and the net effect on output is given as Y = YG + YT = G/(1 – mpc ) – T  mpc /(1 – mpc ) = G[1/(1 – mpc ) – mpc / (1 – mpc )] = G. Thus, if both taxes and government spending incre ase by the same amount, output will increase by exactly the amount of the increase in spending (or increase in taxes). 24. Consider an economy described by the following data :  = $3.25 trillion ̅ = $1.3 trillion  = $3.5 trillion  = $3.0 trillion  = - $1.0 trillion  = 1 mpc = 0.75 d = 0.3 x = 0.1 a.

essay,1,"= 1 – 0.3 r. NX = –1 – 0.1 r. b. Derive an expression for the IS curve. The IS curve can be found by setting Y = Yad and solving: Y = 1 + 0.75 Y + 1 – 0.3 r + 3.5 –1 – 0.1 r. This implies 0.25 Y = 4.5 – 0.4 r, or Y = 18 – 1.6 r. c. If the real interest rate is r = 2, what is equilibrium output? If r = 5, what is equilibrium output? At r = 2, equilibrium output is Y = 18 – 1.6(2) = $14.8 trillion; At r = 5, equilibrium output is Y = 18 – 1.6(5) = $10 trillion. d. Draw a graph of the IS curve showing the",,,,,,"s from part (c) above. e. If government purchases increase to $4.2 trillion, what will happen to equilibrium output at r = 2? What will happen to equilibrium output at r = 5? Show the effect of the increase in government purchases in your gra ph from part (d). An increase of government spending of $0.7 trillion will lead to an 0.7/(1 – 0.75) = $2.8 trillion increase in equilibrium output at a ny given interest rate. Thus, the IS curve will shift horizontally to the right by $2.8 trillion. 25. Consider an economy described by the following data :  = $4 trillion ̅ = $1.5 trillion  = $3.0 trillion  = $3.0 trillion  = $1.0 trillion  = 0 mpc = 0.8 d = 0.35 x = 0.15 a. Derive an expression for the IS curve. Using equation (12) in the chapter, the IS curve is given as Y = 35.5 – 2.5 r. b. Assume that the Federal Reserve controls the intere st rate and sets the interest rate at r = 4. What is the equilibrium level of output? At an interest rate of Y = 35.5 – 2.5(4) = 25.5. c. Suppose that a financial crisis begins, and  increases to  = 3. What will happen to equilibrium output? If the Federal Reserv e can set the interest rate, then at what level should the interest rate be set to keep output from changing? The IS curve is now Y = 30.25 – 2.5 r; at an interest rate of 4, equilibrium output is now Y = 20.25. In order to maintain the output level fro m part (b), the Federal Reserve would have to set the interest rates such t hat 25.5 = 30.25 – 2.5 r, implying the interest rate setting of to offset the increase in f of 3. Thus, the Federal Reserve will reduce d. Suppose the financial crisis causes  to increase as indicated in part (c) and also causes planned autonomous investment to decrease to ̅ = $1.1 trillion. Will the change in the interest rate implemented by the Fede ral Reserve in part (c) be effective in stabilizing output? If not, what addit ional monetary or fiscal policy changes could be implemented to stabilize output at the original equilibrium output level given in part (b)? f,IY = $25.5 trillion. ANSWERS TO DATA ANALYSIS PROBLEMS 1. Go to the St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database a nd find data on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCEC), Personal Consumpti on Expenditures: Durable Goods (PCDG), Personal Consumption Expenditures: No ndurable Goods (PCND), and Personal Consumption Expenditures: Services (PC ESV). a. According to the most recent data: What percentage of total household expenditures is devoted to the consumption of goods (both durable and nondurable goods)? For 2020:Q2, total personal consumption expenditure s are $13,017.8 billion, nondurable consumption is $2875.7 billion, and dura bles consumption is $1474.2 billion. Thus, nondurables represent 100*2875.7/13, 017.8 = 22.1%, and durables represents 100*1474.2/13,017.8 = 11.3%. Services is the largest part of consumption, at 100*8667.8/13,017.8 = 66.6% b. Given these data, which specific component of house hold expenditures would be most impacted by a reduction in overall household s pending? Explain. Since services are a much larger fraction of consum ption than either nondurables or durable consumption, it would be reasonable to c onclude a decline in household spending would most likely impact service s spending. However, most of the services component is due to housing expense s, which do not change much over business cycles, thus it is more likely that n ondurables, the second largest component, is affected most. 2. Go to the St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database a nd find data on Real Private Domestic Investment (GPDIC1), a measure of the real interest rate; the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Security, TIIS (FII10); and the spread between Baa corporate bonds and the 10-year U.S. Treasury (BAA1 0YM), a measure of financial frictions. For (FII10) and (BAA10YM), convert the f requency setting to “Quarterly,” and download the data into a spreadsheet. For each quarter, add the (FII10) and (BAA10YM) series to create ri, the real interest rate for investments for that q uarter. Then calculate the change in both investment and ri as the change in each variable from the previous quarter. a. For the eight most recent quarters of data availabl e, calculate the change in investment from the previous quarter, and then calc ulate the average change over the eight most recent quarters. From 2018:Q3 to 2020:Q2, the average change in inve stment was –$64.4 (billion) per quarter. b. Assume there is a one-quarter lag between movements in ri and changes in investment; in other words, if ri changes in the current quarter, it will affect investment in the next quarter. For the eight most recent lagged quarters of data available, calculate the one-quarter-lagged average change in ri. From 2018:Q2 to 2020:Q1, the average change in ri was 0.01. c. Take the ratio of your answer from part (a) divided by your answer from part (b). What does this value represent? Briefly explain. The ratio of the changes is –64.4/0.01 = –6440; the absolute value of this represents the coefficient on the investment functi on; that is, for every one percentage point increase in ri, real private domestic investment decreases by about $6440 billion. Note that this is what you sho uld expect in theory, as the real interest rate for investments and investment should be negatively related. d. Repeat parts (a) through (c) for the period 2008:Q3 to 2009:Q2. How do financial frictions help explain the behavior of in vestment during the financial crisis? How do the coefficients on investment compa re between the current period and the financial crisis period? Briefly explain. From 2008:Q3 to 2009:Q2, the average change in inve stment was –$166.0 (billion), and from 2008:Q2 to 2009:Q1, the average change in ri was 0.71. The coefficient on investment d during that period is the absolute value of – 166.0/0.71, or d = 233.8. Thus, for every one percentage point incre ase in ri, real private domestic investment would fall by about $23 3.8 billion. The financial frictions component partly helps explain the signif icant decline in investments during the financial crisis period despite real int erest rates being relatively low; however, other factors are clearly at play that are affecting the value of the two coefficients that can’t be captured by the financia l frictions data series. 1 Copyright © 2022 Pearson Education, Ltd.The Economics ofMoney,BankingandFinancial Markets,13e (Mishkin),Global Edition Chapter 22 The MonetaryPolicyand Aggregate Demand Curves 22.1 The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy"

essay,32,Discuss three channels by which monetary policy affects stock prices and aggregate spending.,,,,,,"The answer should include three of the following: In Tobin's q theory, a monetary expansion increases stock prices, increasing the value of the firm relative to the cost of new capital. This stimulates investment in new capital goods, which in turn increases aggregate spending. A monetary expansion increases stock prices, increasing wealth and stimulating consumption and aggregate spending. Expansionary monetary policy increases equity prices. This improves firms' balance sheets, reducing adverse selection and moral hazard and increasing lending for investment, which increases aggregate spending. In the household liquidity effect, the increase in equity prices due to a monetary expansion improves consumer balance sheets, reducing the probability of financial distress, and increasing consumer spending on durable goods and housing.
